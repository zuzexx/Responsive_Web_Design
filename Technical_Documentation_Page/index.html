          <p>CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc. </p>
          <p> A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
          <p>Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="CSS_and_HTML"> <header>CSS and HTML</header>
          <p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.</li>
            <li>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document. </li>
          </ul>
          <p> A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. </p>
          
          <h3> A quick CSS example </h3>
          
          <p> The above descriptions may or may not have made sense, so let's make sure things are clear by presenting a quick example. First of all, let's take a simple HTML document, containing an &lt;h1&gt; and a &lt;p&gt; (notice that a stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a &lt;link&gt; element):</p>
         <pre> <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
          </code></pre>
          <p> Now let's look at a very simple CSS example containing two rules:</p>
          <pre> <code>
          h1 {
        color: blue;
        background-color: yellow;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
      p {
        color: red;
      }
      </code> </pre>
          <p> The first rule starts with an h1 selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the &lt;h1&gt; element. It contains three properties and their values (each property/value pair is called a declaration): </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first one sets the text color to blue.</li>
            <li>The second sets the background color to yellow.</li>
            <li>The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not dotted, or dashed, etc.), and colored black.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The second rule starts with a p selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the &lt;p&lt> element. It contains one declaration, which sets the text color to red. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="How_CSS_works"> <header>How CSS works</header>
          <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in two stages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.</li>
            <li>The browser displays the contents of the DOM.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="About_the_DOM"> <header>About the DOM</header>
          <p>A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.</p>
          <p>Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up.</p>
          <h3>DOM Representation </h3>
          <p>Rather than a long, boring explanation, let's take an example to see how the DOM and CSS work together.</p>
          <p> Let's assume the following HTML code:</p>
          <pre><code>
          &lt;p&gt;
      Let's use:
        &lt;span&gt;Cascading&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Style&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Sheets&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="section_5"> <header>Section 5</header></section>
        <section class="main-section" id="section_6"> <header>Section 6</header></section>
        
      </main>
